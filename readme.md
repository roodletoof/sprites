Asset collection for ebitengine.

Mostly auto-generated collection of the [dungeon crawl stone soup assets](https://opengameart.org/content/dungeon-crawl-32x32-tiles).
I keep using them for quick prototypes, so I wanted autocompletion for
all the sprites in the collection.

Loads all the sprites on initialisation as a bunch of public variables.

generate_sprites.go.py was generated by chatgpt, and is slightly wrong.
So I tweaked the code manually a little.
